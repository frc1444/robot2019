### Conventions
* Use tabs in .java files
* Use 4 spaces in gradle configuration
* lowerCamelCase for methods and variables
* PascalCase for classes
* Use doubles instead of floats

* Only use ```this.``` when necessary
* Use Shuffleboard for as much as possible and use SmartDashboard for unimportant debugging
